# Parkit: Solving Urban Parking Challenges 🚗
## 🚩 Problem Statement
Urban areas are facing an ever-growing challenge of parking shortages, congestion, and inefficient use of available parking spaces.
As cities expand, the demand for parking spots increases, leading to frustration for drivers, wasted time, and unnecessary fuel consumption while searching for available spots. Similarly, businesses and property owners often have unused parking spaces that could be monetized but lack an efficient platform to connect with drivers in need.

<h3>Key Challenges:</h3>

For users (drivers):
Difficulty in finding available parking spaces, especially during peak hours.
Wasting time and fuel driving around searching for spots.
Lack of transparency regarding parking availability and prices.
For providers (parking space owners):
Inability to optimize and monetize underutilized parking spaces.
Lack of a streamlined system for managing spot availability and user bookings.
There is a clear need for a solution that bridges the gap between drivers looking for parking and providers offering available spaces.

### Our Solution:
Parkit bridges the gap between drivers looking for parking and providers offering available spaces by offering a streamlined, user-friendly platform for both parties.
